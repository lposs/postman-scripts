This repo provides a series of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collections in JSON format that
can be imported to help you interact with OpenAM. You should install Postman and then import the
collection(s) you want to use.

If you want to contribute back modifications and/or improvements, you can use the Postman collection
export feature, and either export over the top if you're updating, or export a fresh file if you're
adding a new collection.
